"pip install PyPDF2"
To open the PDF files we need this package which is named as "pip install PyPDF2" 
Once the "pip install PyPDF2" package has been installed it will ask you to restart the kernel(if you working in jupiter notebook)
For restarting you can simply press "ctrl+shift+R"

"import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')"
After restarting the kernel you will need to import the package which is named as nltk
Using nltk package we download punkt which is used to train our dataset
Using nltk package we download stopwords which is used to remove unnecessary words from our text

"import re
import pypdf2
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
import string"
Here we first import regular expression package
Next we import PyPDF2 package for opening resume which is in pdf format (Before we installed the PyPDF2 packafe and now we opening that PyPDF2 package don't get confused)
Then we have to import sub package "stopwords" from nltk.corpus
For finding tokens in our text we use nltk.tokens and it will find the tokenization words from the text
Atlast we import string package
